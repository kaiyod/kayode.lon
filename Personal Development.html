			<p align="justify">The book underscores the significance of assuming responsibility for our actions and their outcomes. It encourages introspection
			regarding areas in our lives where we can take greater ownership and accountability. This may involve establishing well-defined objectives and 
			devising plans to attain them. The text also stresses the importance of setting specific, measurable, and attainable goals in both our personal 
			and professional realms. It delves into the idea of cultivating strong character and upholding integrity, prompting us to contemplate how our 
			actions align with our values for a more principled life. Furthermore, the book frequently delves into the theme of personal growth. It urges us to 
			consider how we can integrate continuous learning into our daily routines, whether through reading, enrolling in courses, or seeking mentorship. 
			Recognizing the paramount role of meaningful relationships in both personal and career success, encourages us to assess ways to fortify our 
			current connections and foster new ones</p>

			<h2><u>Problem-Solving</u></h2>
			</font>
			
			<hr align="left" width="15%" />
			<p>Problem-solving is at the core of coding. Software developers encounter a wide range of challenges, from debugging code to designing complex 
			algorithms.	Identifying the problem is to clearly understand the problem you need to solve. This involves breaking down complex issues into 
			smaller, manageable parts. Algorithmic thinking Developers often need to devise algorithms to solve specific problems efficiently. This requires
			logical thinking and designing a step-by-step approach.	Debugging is When code doesn't work as expected, developers must troubleshoot and debug 
			to find and fix errors.</p></br>

			<h2><u>Data integrity</u></h2>
			</font>
			
			<hr align="left" width="15%" />
			<p>Data integrity refers to the accuracy and reliability of data within a software system. Ensuring data integrity is critical for building
			robust and trustworthy applications. Inputting validation when coding is essential to sanitize user inputs to prevent data corruption or malicious
			attacks. Error handling is a robust error-handling mechanisms that must be implemented to handle unexpected situations gracefully and maintain data 
			integrity. Storage of data is when data is stored in databases or files, developers must use appropriate techniques to ensure data consistency.
			Encryption and Security is protecting sensitive data through encryption and other security measures is vital to maintain data integrity.</p></br>

			<hr align="left" width="15%" />
			<h2><u>Creative Thinking</u></h2>
			</font>
			
			<hr align="left" width="15%" />
			<p>Creative thinking is not often associated with coding, but it's essential for developing innovative solutions and thinking outside the box.
			Problem Reinterpretation is when creative thinkers can reinterpret problems to come up with novel approaches and solutions that others might not
			have considered. Algorithm Design is the creative thinking that can lead to the development of unique algorithms or data structures that are more
			efficient or elegant. User Experience is when we design user interfaces and user experiences. Optimization is finding creative ways to optimize 
			code or make it more maintainable can lead to significant improvements in software quality.</p></br>
